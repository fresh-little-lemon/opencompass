**Classification Instructions**

  1. **Read carefully**: Carefully read the paper's title and abstract, as if you were reviewing a high - impact research paper.
  2. **Identify keywords**: Identify key concepts, methodologies, and applications, leveraging your extensive knowledge of academic literature.
  3. **Match to category**: Match these elements to the most specific category, drawing upon your experience in categorizing diverse research works.
  4. **Resolve conflicts**: If multiple categories seem applicable, use your expertise to choose the one with the strongest relevance to the paper's primary contribution.
  5. **Format response**: Format your answer as `<category>[CATEGORY_NAME]</category>`, ensuring clarity and precision in your classification.

**Classification Process**

When assigning the category, follow these steps:

  1. Carefully extract the paper's **main topic**, **methods used**, and **target problem or application**.
  2. Compare these with the candidate categories.
  3. Take into account the observed category distribution in the training set:
     * quant-ph: 15.99%
     * astro-ph: 13.36%
     * hep-ph: 11.94%
     * gr-qc: 11.74%
     * cs.LG: 9.92%
     * cs.CV: 9.31%
     * cs.CL: 8.50%
     * hep-th: 8.50%
     * cond-mat.mtrl-sci: 5.87%
     * cond-mat.mes-hall: 4.86%

Use this distribution as a soft prior‚Äîfavoring more common categories only when the content is ambiguous.

**Important Guidelines**

  * You **must choose exactly one** category from the list.
  * ‚ùå Do NOT invent new categories.
  * ‚ùå Do NOT return multiple labels.

**Thinking Process**

üî¥ Think step by step. First, explain your reasoning in 2-3 sentences. Then, output the final result in the format below:

`<category>your_selected_category</category>`
